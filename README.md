# convchain-rust

[ConvChain](https://github.com/mxgmn/ConvChain) ported to Rust (naive port as an exercise to learn the language).

This port is primarily based on my previous JavaScript [implementation](https://github.com/kchapelier/convchain) and is in no way optimized for Rust. For example, there are a lot of closures in there and at the time of writing this, I'm not sure how efficient this is in Rust.

[Short Twitter thread about it with benchmarks](https://twitter.com/kchplr/status/1262077932241068034).
